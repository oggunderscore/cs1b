CS1B - Introduction to Computer Science II
==========================================

This repository contains all of the source code for my programming projects in CS1B.

## project-serendipity
The program is a POS (Point of Sale) software which functions as a cashier to a users and a database to keep track of all the books in the inventory. It is a semester-long project meant to demonstrate understanding of all concepts taught in the course.

## project-weather
This program stores and outputs the highest and lowest temperatures for each month of the year using a two-dimensional array. It then calculates and outputs the average high and low temperatures for the given year. 

## project-grades
This program reads in data from a file (answer key and student ID / answers on next line) and calculates the score on the test based on specified grading conditions.
## project-structs
This program reads data for football players and stores relevent information in a a struct, `playerType`.

## project-constructors
This program hardcodes 5 people of type `personType` using the `personType` class and prints their relevent information name, address, DOB, height, and gender). The program then makes 2 comparisons between 2 different people and the same person to test the equals function.
## project-creditcard
This program creates 3 credit cards using the `creditcardType` class on the same account (same name) and make 3 purchases with each card to demonstrate the use of static variables and functions.
## project-inheritance
This program hardcodes 3 people of type `studentType` using the `studentType` class and inherits from the personType class the attributes of a person. The program then prints out the students and people and makes comparisons amongst the 3 students to test the equals function override in `studentType`.
